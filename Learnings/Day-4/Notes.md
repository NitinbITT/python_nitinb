## Composition
* It is where an object of a class built using the object of another class.
* Eg: A user class has an account.

## Association:
* It is where an object is created such that it is referenced inside another class.
Eg: Creating an object of account outside of user class. Giving loose coupling of deleting the object later.It can just use the class

## Aggregation:
* It is where a class is created such that is can be deleted eventhough it has objects inside it.
* Eg : Creating an object of account object outside the class and it is weakly has a realtionship with the class .

### Delegation:
* Delegation is a technique used in oop and it is not a relationship. 
* It is where the work of one object is sent to another.
* Another object will be performing its actions

## Iterators:
* Iterators are used to iterate over an iterable objects.
* Objects like list,tuple,dictionary,set are iterable.
* Each has its iter() method.
